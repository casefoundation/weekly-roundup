## About

Weekly Roundup is a news clipping and emailing tool built for the Case Foundation's internal communications team. The tool scrapes metadata (title, date, publicaiton, and description) from submitted URLs, then formats the information into a newsletter that users may organize and edit before sending. The system distributes the newsletter via SendGrid.
